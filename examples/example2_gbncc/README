DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is a minimal rf_pipelines run which incoherently dedisperses a GBNCC data
file in PSRFITS format.  It includes simple detrending, but no RFI removal, 
so the output is a mess!  This example is intended to supersede gbncc-snapshot.cpp 
in the 'bonsai' github repo.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING
------------------------

First you'll need to generate the bonsai config hdf5 file from the bonsai text file.
(This is a temporary workaround for a currently-unimplemented feature in bonsai: on-the-fly
estimation of trigger variances.)

    bonsai-mkweight bonsai_config.txt bonsai_config.hdf5

Then rule the example:

   ./example2-gbncc.py

This will generate a bunch of waterfall plots plus a file 'triggers.hdf5' containing
coarse-grained triggers.  The trigger file can be plotted with:

   bonsai-plot-triggers.py triggers.hdf5

[ XXX finish ]
