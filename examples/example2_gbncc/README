DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is a minimal rf_pipelines run which incoherently dedisperses a GBNCC data
file in PSRFITS format.  It includes simple detrending, but no RFI removal, 
so the output is a mess!  This example is intended to supersede gbncc-snapshot.cpp 
in the 'bonsai' github repo.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING
------------------------

First you'll need to generate the bonsai config hdf5 file from the bonsai text file.
(This is a temporary workaround for a currently-unimplemented feature in bonsai: on-the-fly
estimation of trigger variances.)

    bonsai-mkweight bonsai_config.txt bonsai_config.hdf5

Then rule the example:

   ./example2-gbncc.py

This will generate a bunch of waterfall plots plus a file 'triggers.hdf5' containing
coarse-grained triggers.  The trigger file can be plotted with:

   bonsai-plot-triggers.py triggers.hdf5

After running the pipeline, you should see a waterfall plot 'detrended_gbncc_0.png' and files 
triggers_tree*.png showing the dedispersion outputs.  There are 4 dedispersion output
files because the bonsai configuration file defines four trees to search different parts of
parameter space.  The github repo contains "reference" versions of some of these plots for
comparison.

All the output files show a ton of RFI since there is no masking!
Maybe you can improve this?
